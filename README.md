# My-projects

These are some of the projects I have worked on in the field of Machine Learning:

1. Human face detection using Boosting techniques – AdaBoost and RealBoost

Haar-filters were used as weak classifiers to build a strong classifier as an ensemble using AdaBoost and RealBoosting. 

2. Face Social Traits and Political Election Analysis by SVM

A fully automated system that can infer the perceived traits of a person from his face – 
social dimensions, such as “intelligence,” “honesty,” and “competence” – and how those traits can be used to predict the outcomes of real-world social events that involve long-term commitments, such as political elections.
It is a hierarchical model for enduring traits inferred from faces, incorporating high-level perceptions and intermediate-level attributes. The trained model can successfully classify the outcomes of
elections, only using the photographs of politicians’ faces. It classifies the winners of a series of recent U.S. elections with the accuracy of 67.9% (Governors) and 65.5% (Senators). 

3. Yelp review rating prediction

In this project subset of the original Yelp data was used and the goal is: when given a pair of (user, business), predict the rating that user will give to the business in a review. To solve this
problem,features were extracted from the data, selected a subset of the features to use, trained a model with the features, calculated RMSE to evaluate, and readjusted the features/models used.

4. Analyzing Human Faces by PCA, Autoencoder, and FLD

Performed dimensionality reduction and reconstruction of facial images using Eigen-faces, Conv-Deconv architectures, and gender discrimination using FLD. Random faces were synthesized by interpolation and subsampling.

5.Feature Extraction and Image Classification for 3D Data

Explored which classifiers may work on 3D image data and what changes and improvements are required and/or possible to achieve maximum accuracy.

6. Classification Analysis on Textual Data

Constructed tf-idf representations of textual data, implemented various common classification methods,evaluated and diagnosed classification results, performed two dimensionality reduction methods: PCA & NMF.
Includes the complete pipeline of a textual data classification task

7. Clustering on Textual Data:

implement K-means clustering on the dataset, and evaluate the performance of the clustering.Also did different preprocessing methods which did increase the performance of the clustering.
